# podcast-dl

This project allows you to download videos that are distributed
using [Apple's podcast RSS feed](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements).

Currently, a Go toolchain is required to build the program:

```bash
go get github.com/elwin/podcast-dl
```

After that, you can run it using `podcast-dl [url]`.
